This green or brown growth appears on surfaces exposed to moisture and shade, particularly roofs, gutters, patios, and driveways.",whatIs:"Moss is a primitive plant that thrives in damp, cool conditions. It appears as a green or brown carpet-like growth that spreads across outdoor surfaces. Unlike algae, which forms a slimy coating, moss creates substantial growth that can reach several centimeters thick.",causes:"Moss grows because our North West climate provides perfect conditions—regular rainfall, high humidity, and frequent shade create the damp environment moss needs. Tree coverage, gutters that retain water, and poorly draining surfaces all accelerate moss growth. North-facing properties and areas under tree canopies are particularly susceptible.",risksDangers:"Moss creates multiple risks. It makes surfaces slippery and creates fall hazards, particularly on roofs and patios. It retains moisture against underlying surfaces, leading to accelerated deterioration, algae growth, and eventual structural damage. On roofs, moss buildup prevents proper water drainage and can cause leaks. Left unchecked, moss infestations become progressively worse and more expensive to treat.",affectedSurfaces:["roof-tiles","gutters","patios","driveways","block-paving","tarmac","stone","concrete","timber"],seasons:"Moss grows year-round but becomes most visible in autumn and winter when conditions are dampest.

Once established, it spreads and thickens rapidly. Within a year, a light coating can become 2-3 cm thick, creating serious hazards and structural risks.",metaTitle:"Moss Growth & Removal | Professional Cleaning Solution",metaDescription:"Moss on roof, patio, or driveway? Learn causes and get professional moss removal. Prevent moss growth with expert cleaning service.",faqs:[{q:"Why is moss such a common problem in the North West?",a:"Our climate is perfect for moss growth. Regular rainfall, high humidity, and many shaded properties create the exact conditions moss needs. This is why moss is more common here than in drier regions."},{q:"Is moss just cosmetic or does it cause real damage?",a:"Moss is far more than cosmetic. It retains moisture against surfaces, accelerating decay. On roofs, it blocks water drainage and can cause leaks. On patio stones, it creates slip hazards. Professional removal prevents these serious problems."},{q:"Can I remove moss myself?",a:"DIY moss removal is possible but risky. Roof moss requires dangerous ladder work. DIY cleaning often misses deep moss roots, leading to rapid regrowth. Professional soft washing removes moss completely and treats underlying surfaces to prevent rapid regrowth."},{q:"How often do I need professional moss removal?",a:"This depends on your property's shade and drainage. North-facing properties under trees might need annual treatment. Properties in open, sunlit areas might only need cleaning every 2-3 years. We recommend professional inspection to assess your specific situation."},{q:"What's the difference between moss treatment and just power washing?",a:"Standard pressure washing can remove moss but often damages surfaces and doesn't prevent regrowth. Professional soft washing uses appropriate pressure and biocides to remove moss safely and effectively while treating surfaces to slow future growth."}]},"algae-discoloration":{slug:"algae-discoloration",name:"Algae & Discoloration",displayName:"Algae Staining & Black Spot Discoloration",description:"Algae and discoloration appear as black, green, or brown staining on exterior surfaces. This common problem accelerates rapidly in damp conditions and significantly impacts property appearance.",whatIs:"Algae discoloration forms as single-celled or colonial algae colonize exterior surfaces. Unlike moss, algae creates a slimy, staining growth rather than thick carpet growth. Black algae (most common in UK) appears as dark staining that makes surfaces look dirty and aged.",causes:"Algae thrives in damp conditions with regular moisture exposure. Wind-driven rain on north-facing surfaces, spray from gutters, and poor drainage all encourage algae growth. Shaded areas with reduced sunlight create ideal conditions. Gutters, roof tiles, render, and patios are particularly vulnerable.",risksDangers:"While less immediately hazardous than moss, algae staining significantly impacts property appearance and marketability.

Professional algae removal stops discoloration.

North-facing surfaces, shaded areas, and those near gutters are most vulnerable. This is common in damp climates like ours."},{q:"Does algae damage the underlying surface?",a:"Yes. Algae holds moisture against surfaces, accelerating deterioration. Under the staining, render and mortar begin breaking down. Professional removal stops this damage process."},{q:"Can algae come back quickly?",a:"In optimal moisture conditions, regrowth can occur within 12-18 months. Professional soft washing includes treatments that slow algae regrowth.

Unlike moss, lichen growth is very slow but can persist for many years.",causes:"Lichen grows in clean air areas exposed to moisture and established on hard surfaces. It thrives on brick, stone, and concrete. Slow growth means lichen-covered properties are often older or long-neglected.",risksDangers:"Although slow-growing, lichen penetrates surface structure.
