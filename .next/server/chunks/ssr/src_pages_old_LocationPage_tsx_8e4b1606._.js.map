Safe, effective, long-lasting results.',\n    longDescription: 'Soft washing is a specialist cleaning method that uses low-pressure water combined with biodegradable cleaning solutions to safely clean delicate surfaces that cannot tolerate high-pressure washing. Unlike aggressive pressure washing that can damage surfaces and cause costly repairs, soft washing gently removes biological growth and staining while preserving surface integrity. Our professional soft washing service is ideal for roofs, render, brick facades, timber, and other delicate exterior materials.',\n    whatIs: 'Soft washing is a professional cleaning method using low-pressure water (typically under 100 PSI) combined with specialized biodegradable cleaning solutions formulated to break down biological growth and staining without causing surface damage. This approach is far safer and more effective for delicate materials than high-pressure washing.',\n    whyNeeded: 'Many exterior surfaces—particularly roofs, render, brick, and timber—cannot safely withstand high-pressure washing. High pressure can damage surface finishes, force water beneath protective coatings, displace materials, and cause long-term structural problems. Soft washing provides professional cleaning power using chemicals that kill growth at the root rather than relying purely on water pressure. This approach prevents quick regrowth and delivers superior, longer-lasting results.',\n    howDone: 'We apply specialized soft wash solutions formulated for your specific surface and problem. These solutions break down algae, moss, lichen, and staining at the root. After allowing appropriate dwell time for chemical action, we use low-pressure water to gently rinse away debris. Many treatments include a protective biocide component that continues protecting your surface for months after cleaning.',\n    whenNeeded: 'Soft washing frequency depends on surface type and exposure, typically ranging from annually to every 2-3 years. With biocide protection, results last longer and regrowth is significantly slower.

Soft washing is safer for delicate materials and more effective at killing growth at the root, preventing quick regrowth.'\n      },\n      {\n        q: 'Is soft washing environmentally friendly?',\n        a: 'Yes, we use biodegradable, environmentally-approved cleaning solutions.
